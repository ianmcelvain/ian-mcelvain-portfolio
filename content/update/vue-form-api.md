This shows the bare bones of a form API/builder system with Vue 3 composition API. One entry component takes in a data object with the form fields and returns a form back exposing the internals for dynamic use cases.

The above screenshot uses the same component but with different data objects for the form. Each data object contains the field types to use, validation logic, and style depictions.
